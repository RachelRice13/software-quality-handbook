# Task Estimation
Task Estimation is an essential part of the agile process, it allows developers to estimate the effort needed to complete tasks from the product backlog. It allows developers to measure how much time a task will take and plan sprints more accurately. Task Estimation occurs during a Sprint Planning meeting, which is a time-boxed event where the team will discuss and determine the work that will be done in the upcoming sprint. Task Estimation is crucial in helping the team to understand the capacity they have for the upcoming sprint and to prioritize the work that needs to be done.
