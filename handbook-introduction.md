# Company Handbook on Software
## Introduction
Welcome to the Company Handbook on Software Quality! This handbook is a compilation of best practices for software quality that every engineer in our company should follow. The purpose of this document is to establish a common standard of excellence in our development practices and to improve the quality of our software.

This handbook is organized into three main sections: 
 - Task Estimation in Scrum, 
 - Code Reviews,  
 - Software Testing. 
 
 Each section will provide a brief overview of the topic, followed by a summary of the most important guidelines and bad practices to avoid. We have also included links to reference articles for further reading.

We encourage every team member to read this handbook thoroughly and incorporate the best practices into their work. By doing so, we can ensure that our software is of the highest quality and meets the needs of our customers.
